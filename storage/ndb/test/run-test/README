run-test/README

This document describes how atrt works and how to use it.

atrt is a test program driver.
atrt supports fully distributed test and utilizes ndb_cpcd.

===================================================
/**
  * Pseudo code for main atrt algorithm
  */

  read config file (default d.txt)
  contact each ndb_cpcd

  read all test cases

  start cluster
  if cluster start has failures do
    report overall critical failure
    attempt to clean up any left over process
    exit
  end if

  run all tests

  stop cluster

/**
 * End of pseudo code for main atrt algorithm
 */



/**
  * Pseudo code for atrt test run algorithm
  */

  for each test case do
    while test_runs < total_test_run_attemps do
      if test_forces_restart
        stop all processes
      if cluster is stopped then
        deploy all configurations
        start all processes
      end if

      if cluster ok then
        set cluster as started
        run test and wait for test to finish
      else
        set test result as critical failure
      end if

      gather all log results

      stop_cluster = (test status != ok)
                   || cluster_configuration_changed
      if (stop_cluster)
        stop all processes
        set cluster as stopped
      end if

    done while retries

  done processing tests

/**
  * End of pseudo code for atrt test run algorithm
  */
