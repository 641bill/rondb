/**
 * We want the compiler to vectorize the xor-loop using SSE extensions.
 * Preferably quad-word-aligned memory access instructions should be
 * used as well.
 *
 * Benchmarking and assembly inspection has proved that Clang produce
 * vectorized code with the standard BUILD_TYPE=Release/RelWithDebInfo
 * compiler options.
 *
 * GCC need the 'vectorize' compiler pragma to be specified, see below
 *
 * Clang is also able to use quad-word-aligned memory access, but this
 * comes with some initial setup overhead in finding the aligned start.
 * This is why we only do this for larger memory blocks.
 *
 * No alignment improvements were found when testing with GCC.
 * Thus we left this out for this platform, in favour of a simpler implementation.
 *
 * Overall, Clang generated code seems to be ~10-20% faster than GCC.
 * When calculating checksum on memory objects fitting in the L1 cache,
 * Clang code peaked out at ~120Gb/2, while GCC reached ~100Gb/s.
 *
 * The performance improvement of getting the code vectorized is ~8x!
 * (i7-10875H CPU, @5.1 GHz)
