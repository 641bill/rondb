/******************************************************
This file contains functions that need to be added to
MySQL code but have not been added yet.

Whenever you add a function here submit a MySQL bug
report (feature request) with the implementation. Then
write the bug number in the comment before the
function in this file.

When MySQL commits the function it can be deleted from
here. In a perfect world this file exists but is empty.
