	include/page0zip.ic, page/page0zip.c,
	mysql-test/innodb_bug36172.test:
	Prevent infinite B-tree page splits in compressed tables by
	ensuring that there will always be enough space for two node
	pointer records in an empty B-tree page.  Also, require that at
	least one data record will fit in an empty compressed page.  This
	will reduce the maximum size of records in compressed tables.

2008-07-30	The InnoDB Team

	* trx/trx0trx.c:
