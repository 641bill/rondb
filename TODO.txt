- run sysbench performance tests (Norvald, Jeb). Roy has
  scripts if I need to run myself

- check with RAPID what to do about queries now failing:
  MySQL is smarter than before with mixed DISTINCT ALL:
  Query:
        explain format=tree
        SELECT * FROM t1 UNION DISTINCT
        SELECT * FROM t2 UNION ALL
        SELECT * FROM t3;
  old plan:
  -> Table scan on <union_level_1>  (cost=0.43..2.58 rows=6)
    -> Union materialize with deduplication  (cost=2.38..4.53 rows=6)
        -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.45 rows=2)
        -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.45 rows=2)
        -> Disable deduplication
            -> Table scan on t3  (cost=0.45 rows=2)

  new plan:
  -> Append
    -> Stream results  (cost=0.64..2.55 rows=4)
        -> Table scan on <union_level_2>  (cost=0.64..2.55 rows=4)
            -> Union materialize with deduplication  (cost=1.94..3.85 rows=4)
                -> Table scan on t1  (cost=0.45 rows=2)
                -> Table scan on t2  (cost=0.45 rows=2)
    -> Stream results  (cost=0.45 rows=2)
        -> Table scan on t3  (cost=0.45 rows=2)

   that is, the rows from t3 are not written to the materialized table
   now.
   Look for the string "dhw" in RAPID test files for occurences, where I had
   to accept non-offloads for the tests to complete. RAPID
   needs to understand such plans.

Before final commit:

- remove this TODO
- remove Emacs comments from files



Next steps:

- make executing support for EXCEPT
- make executing support for INTERSECT
