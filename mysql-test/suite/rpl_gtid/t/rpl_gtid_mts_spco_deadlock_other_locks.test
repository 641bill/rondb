# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test's goal is to check that no deadlock occurs in an SPCO enabled
# multi-threaded replica when client connections issue global locking or
# ACL statements concurrently with the applier worker threads.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
#
# R1. A multi-threaded applier with enabled commit order preservation MUST
#     be able to break deadlocks mixing commit order serialization and
#     global locks like the ones taken by `SET READ_ONLY = ON` or `FLUSH
#     TABLES WITH READ LOCK`.
#
# R2. A multi-threaded applier with enabled commit order preservation MUST
#     be able to break deadlocks mixing commit order serialization and ACL
#     related locks.
#
# R3. A multi-threaded applier with enabled commit order preservation MUST
#     keep the current retry behavior by enforcing the
#     `slave_transaction_retries` variable value for the amount of retries,
#     when requested to back-off a transaction deadlocked by _R1_ and _R2_
#     described scenarios.
#
# R4. A multi-threaded applier with enabled commit order preservation MUST
#     keep the current replication channel behavior by stopping both the
#     coordinator and worker threads when the configured amount of
#     transaction retries is reached unsuccessfully, when requested to
#     back-off a transaction deadlocked by _R1_ and _R2_ described
#     scenarios.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Setup
#   1. Create two tables on the source
#   2. Setup replica to be multi-threaded
#
# TC1. `GLOBAL READ_ONLY=ON` issued by client and DDL replicated from source.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. Alter a table and insert rows on the source in a way that they will
#      belong to the same commit group and scheduled to be parallelized on
#      the replica.
#   2. On the replica, using client connection A, start a transaction and
#      assign it the same GTID as the first statement issued on the source.
#   3. Start the replication threads
#   4. On the replica, ensure that the applier worker threads are waiting
#      on the pending client connection transaction.
#   5. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `SET GLOBAL
#      READ_ONLY=ON` to acquire the global read lock, leading to the
#      following lock acquisition dependencies: Client B --commit lock-->
#      Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1 --gtid lock--> Client A.
#   6. On the replica, ensure that client connection B is waiting on the
#      lock being held by Worker 2 or Worker 3.
#   7. On the replica, using client conneciton A, rollback the pending
#      transaction, leading to the following lock acquisition dependencies:
#      Client B --commit lock--> Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1
#      --global read lock--> Client B.
#   8. Wait for the client connection B to error out with ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK.
#   9. Synchronize the replica with the source.
#
# TC2. `GLOBAL READ_ONLY=ON` issued by client and DML replicated from source.

#      on the pending client connection transaction.
#   5. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `SET GLOBAL
#      READ_ONLY=ON` to acquire the global read lock, leading to the

#      Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1 --gtid lock--> Client A.
#   6. On the replica, ensure that client connection B is waiting on the
#      lock being held by Worker 2 or Worker 3.
#   7. On the replica, using client conneciton A, rollback the pending
#      transaction, leading to the following lock acquisition dependencies:
#      Client B --commit lock--> Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1
#      --global read lock--> Client B.
#   8. Wait for the replica applier to error out with ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK.
#   9. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `SET GLOBAL
#      READ_ONLY=OFF` to let the applier worker threads to finish after
#      restart of the applier.
#  10. Synchronize the replica with the source.
#
# TC3. `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` issued by client and DDL replicated
#      from source.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. Alter a table and insert rows on the source in a way that they will
#      belong to the same commit group and scheduled to be parallelized on
#      the replica.
#   2. On the replica, using client connection A, start a transaction and
#      assign it the same GTID as the first statement issued on the source.
#   3. Start the replication threads
#   4. On the replica, ensure that the applier worker threads are waiting
#      on the pending client connection transaction.
#   5. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `FLUSH TABLES
#      WITH READ LOCK` to acquire the global read lock, leading to the
#      following lock acquisition dependencies: Client B --commit lock-->
#      Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1 --gtid lock--> Client A.
#   6. On the replica, ensure that client connection B is waiting on the
#      lock being held by Worker 2 or Worker 3.
#   7. On the replica, using client conneciton A, rollback the pending
#      transaction, leading to the following lock acquisition dependencies:
#      Client B --commit lock--> Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1
#      --global read lock--> Client B.
#   8. Wait for the client connection B to error out with ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK.
#   9. Synchronize the replica with the source.
#
# TC4. `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` issued by client and DML replicated
#      from source.
