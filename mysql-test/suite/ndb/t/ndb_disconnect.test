# Testcase for Bug#24444908:
#
#   CLUSTER CRASHED DURING RESTART WITH AN ASSERTION 
#   !CALLBACKOBJ->HAS_DATA_TO
#
# We had no thread concurrency safe way of checking for
# disconnected nodes while sending to them. Thus there
# could be race conditions where a thread passed the
# 'is connected to node <n>' check while another thread 
# disconnected and cleared the send buffers to node <n>.
# If the sending thread then was 'slow', it could append
# more data to the just cleared send buffers.
#
# Upon reconnect we then hit an assert as we assumed the
# send buffers to still be empty.
#
# With release built binaries this resulted in problems as in
# Bug#25128512: ..'WE(1) HAVE BEEN DECLARED DEAD BY 2 (VIA 4)'
# Due to messages created as part of the disconnects not being
# cleared, and was sent after we reconnected again. Thus it
# was interpretted as being yet another disconnect.
