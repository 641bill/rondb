# Step-1) Create M1<->M2 replication topology

# Step-2) Create a sample table to create ignored/skipped
#         insert events on the table.
#
[connection server_1]
CREATE TABLE t1(i INT);
include/rpl_sync.inc
#
# Step-3) If gtid_mode is OFF, set sql_slave_skip_counter to 500 on
#         M2 node and restart sql thread to make the change effective.
#
#         If gtid_mode is ON, execute 500 empty transactions on
#         M2 node, so that 500 transactions from M1 will be skipped.
#
[connection server_2]
include/stop_slave_sql.inc
include/start_slave_sql.inc
#
# Step-4) Record thd::main_mem_root usage values on both servers before
#         starting the experiment.
#
[connection server_1]
[connection server_2]
#
# Step-5) Insert 1000 sample queries on M1 node. First 500 inserts will
#         be ignored on M2 node (because sql_slave_skip_counter set to
#         500). Second 500 inserts will be executed on M2 and will be
#         replicated back to M1 node. But they will be ignored on M1
#         because they were originated on M1 node.
#
[connection server_1]
DROP TABLE t1;
#
# Step-6) Record thd::main_mem_root usage value on M1 after
#         the experiment. Check that thd::main_mem_root value
#         did not increased.
#
include/assert.inc [thd::main_mem_root on M1 should be the same value as before experiment value.]
#
# Step-7) Record thd::main_mem_root usage value on M2 after
#         the experiment. Check that thd::main_mem_root value
#         did not increased.
#
[connection server_2]
include/assert.inc [thd::main_mem_root on M2 should be the same value as before experiment value.]
#
# Step-8) Cleanup.

include/rpl_end.inc
