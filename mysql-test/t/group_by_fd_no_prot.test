# WL#2489: test of detection of functional dependencies
# for only_full_group_by

# Output differs in both modes, because
# - we print trace of FDs
# - but the detection is done only in PREPARE, not EXECUTE
# - in PS mode, the trace is of EXECUTE

# Performance Schema is not supported by embedded server. Hence skip when test runs with embedded mode.
