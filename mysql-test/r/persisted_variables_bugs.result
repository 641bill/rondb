# Bug #27016247: SET PERSIST_ONLY DOES NOT CONSIDER RUNTIME VALIDATION
#
# Should fail: event_scheduler does not allow setting to DISABLED at runtime
SET PERSIST event_scheduler=DISABLED;
ERROR 42000: Variable 'event_scheduler' can't be set to the value of 'DISABLED'
# Should fail: data type still checked even with persist_only
SET PERSIST_ONLY event_scheduler=123.456;
ERROR 42000: Incorrect argument type to variable 'event_scheduler'
# Should work: check not called for PERSIST_ONLY
SET PERSIST_ONLY event_scheduler=DISABLED;
# cleanup
RESET PERSIST event_scheduler;
# End of the 8.0 tests
