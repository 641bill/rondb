/**
  A context for reading through a single table using a chosen access method:
  index read, scan, etc, use of cache, etc.. It is mostly meant as an interface,
  but also contains some private member functions that are useful for many
  implementations, such as error handling.

  A RowIterator is a simple iterator; you initialize it, and then read one
  record at a time until Read() returns EOF. A RowIterator can read from
  other Iterators if you want to (e.g. a UniqueIterator that takes in records
  from another RowIterator and deduplicates them), but we currently have no
  such implementations.

  The abstraction is not completely tight. In particular, it still leaves some
  specifics to TABLE, such as which columns to read (the read_set). This means
  it would probably be hard as-is to e.g. sort a join of two tables.

  TODO: Convert sorting and unique into RowIterator.
  TODO: Convert the join access types into RowIterator (depends on the
        previous item)
  TODO: Convert the joins themselves into RowIterator.

  Use by:
@code
  unique_ptr<RowIterator> iterator(new ...);
  if (iterator->Init(qep_tab))
    return true;
  while (iterator->Read() == 0) {
    ...
  }
@endcode

    QEP_TAB can contain information that will help the RowIterator to
    optimize the read (e.g. push conditions down to NDB, or, for join access
    types such as eq_ref, know which row to read), but it can also choose to
    ignore the parameter entirely. Some Iterators will accept nullptr;
    see the documentation for each.

    You can call Init() multiple times; subsequent calls will rewind the
    iterator (or reposition it, depending on the QEP_TAB) and allow you to
    read the records anew.

  // failed a WHERE predicate, as only the returned rows are protected,
  // not _which_ rows are returned. Thus, if Read() returned a row that you did
  // not actually use, you should call UnlockRow() afterwards, which allows the
  // storage engine to release the row lock in such situations.
