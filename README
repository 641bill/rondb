This is the source of the InnoDB plugin 1.0 alpha1 for MySQL 5.1
================================================================

Instructions for compiling the plugin:
--------------------------------------

1. Get the latest MySQL 5.1 sources from
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#source

2. Replace the contents of the mysql-5.1.N/storage/innobase/ directory
   with the contents of this directory.

3. Optional (only necessary if you are going to run tests from the
   mysql-test suite): cd into the innobase directory and run ./setup.sh

4. Compile MySQL as usual.

5. Enjoy!

Thank you for using the InnoDB plugin!
