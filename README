This project contains the mynode definition and implementation.

To build the native implementation for this project, cd to the Adapter/impl/
directory. The wscript file defines the build process. 
In this directory, call the node-waf program, passing the location of an installed mysql.

For example,
node-waf clean configure build --mysql=/usr/local/mysql-5.1.24-rc-osx10.5-x86_64/

Be sure to include the trailing "/".

This will create the file Adapter/spi/build/Release/ndbapi.node which
will be used to bind to the dynamic ndbclient library identified in the node-waf command.
