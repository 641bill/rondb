This project contains the mynode definition and implementation.

The wscript file is a waf script defining the build process.

In this directory, call the node-waf program, passing the location of an 
installed mysql tree. For example:

% node-waf configure --mysql=/usr/local/mysql-5.1.24-rc-osx10.5-x86_64/
% node-waf build

Be sure to include the trailing "/" in the configure command.

This will create the binary artifacts under Adapter/impl/build/Release/
