This project contains the Mynode definition and implementation.


BUILDING
--------
The wscript file is a waf script defining the build process.

In this directory, run node-waf (the build tool distributed with node.js 0.6), 
passing the location of an installed mysql tree. For example:

% node-waf configure --mysql=/usr/local/mysql-5.1.24-rc-osx10.5-x86_64/
% node-waf build

This will create the binary artifacts under Adapter/impl/build/Release/

Be sure to include the trailing "/" in the configure command.

If you have built a previous version of the project, "node-waf clean"
and "node-waf distclean" might be needed for cleaning up.
