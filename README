This project contains the Mynode definition and implementation.


BUILDING
--------
The wscript file is a waf script defining the build process.

In this directory, run node-waf (the build tool distributed with node.js 0.6), 
passing the location of an installed mysql tree. For example:

% node-waf configure --mysql=/usr/local/mysql-5.1.24-rc-osx10.5-x86_64/
% node-waf build

This will create the binary artifacts under Adapter/impl/build/Release/

If you have built a previous version of the project, "node-waf clean"
and "node-waf distclean" might be needed for cleaning up.

TESTING
-------
Testing currently requires a running MySQL Cluster with both a management 
server and a MySQL server on the local machine. The cluster and mysql server
must be defined with the default server and port. The MySQL server must have
the database "test" created. The mysql client executable must be in the path.

To run the test suite:

cd test
