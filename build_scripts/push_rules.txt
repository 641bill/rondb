Currently RonDB default branch is 22.10.1. Changes should only be pushed to the 21.04 branch if they are required for inclusion into a Hopsworks 3.4 branch or earlier Hopsworks version.

Pushes to 22.10.1 that aren't required in 21.04 only needs a single PR for the 22.10.1 tree. Thus no merges are required.

Anyone pushing to 21.04 also has to create a merge PR that merges the changes into 22.10.1.

All changes done to RonDB intended for release into Hopsworks production systems need to be pushed to 22.10.1 branch.

Major new features of RonDB should not be pushed to RonDB 22.10.1 branch. These features should be pushed to the 24.04 branch.

RonDB 22.10.1 is an LTS branch of RonDB that will be maintained for a few years ahead. Major new features will be available
in development releases and later a new LTS release will be created for use in production environments.
