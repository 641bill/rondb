The rapidjson library included in this directory is based on
https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson, upstream commit
3a4835e080d213c60842f58f207991fbb1c97f74.

There are two changes made to the library:

1) Two lines has been added to reader.h, which fixes an assertion in the library
   when a JSON document contains illegaly escaped unicode characters. See
   upstream commit b7e34100ed167b8134b41fcff0918895dd4e61fb for the changes.

2) Rapidjson-specific changes in commit 91153f3385c4917a215aa4c7818b3f6265608286
   has been applied, so that negative zero is handled properly.
